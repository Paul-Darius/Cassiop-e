A simple Python/Theano deep learning software.

Requirement:
python and theano.

Starting the software:
-> python py2/use_all.py

The overall goal of this program is to provide an easily editable deep neural network working learning from any given database.

The user provides a database and a number of outputs. He decides the architecture of an artificial neural networks by giving a number of layers, a number of neurons per layer, and so on.
He also selects how the neural network will learn to recognize the patterns in his images:
-The learning method: Multilayer Perceptron for supervised learning and Restricted Boltzmann Machine for unsupervised learning in pre-training.
-Other options such as the number of epochs for training.

The software is based on the examples provided by deeplearning.net.
